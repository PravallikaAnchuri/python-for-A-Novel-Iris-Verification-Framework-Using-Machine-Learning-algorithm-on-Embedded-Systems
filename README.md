# A Novel Iris Verification Framework Using Machine Learning algorithm on Embedded Systems

## Procedure:
Collect a dataset of iris images and labels indicating the identity of the person in each image.

Preprocess the iris images to extract features that can be used to distinguish one iris from another. This may involve converting the images to grayscale, detecting circular iris patterns in the images, and extracting features such as the intensity and gradient of the pixels within the iris boundaries.

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Train a machine learning algorithm, such as a support vector machine (SVM), on the training data.

Test the trained model on the test data to evaluate its performance.

Implement the iris verification system on an embedded device, such as a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. This may involve using a camera to capture iris images, extracting features from the images, and using the trained machine learning model to predict the identity of the person in the image.

Test the system on the embedded device to ensure that it is working as expected.
